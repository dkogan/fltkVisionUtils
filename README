A library for simple integration of FLTK, openCV and image sources such as firewire (IIDC) cameras
and video files. Includes some sample programs that show basic usage.

I'm using FLTK 1.3, openCV 2.1.0, libdc1394 2.1.2 and the 2009-07-06 snapshot of FFMPEG 0.5 (the
current packages in debian unstable). I'm developing the library as I use it, so features and the
API are being actively updated.
